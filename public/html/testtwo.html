        <p>The RTX 4060 Ti and RTX 3060 Ti are both powerful graphics cards from Nvidia, but there are some key
            differences between the two.

            The RTX 4060 Ti is based on the new Ada Lovelace architecture, while the RTX 3060 Ti is based on the Turing
            architecture. This means that the RTX 4060 Ti is expected to offer significant performance improvements over
            the RTX 3060 Ti.
            The RTX 4060 Ti has a boost clock speed of 1.86 GHz, while the RTX 3060 Ti has a boost clock speed of 1.67
            GHz. This means that the RTX 4060 Ti can run at higher clock speeds, which can lead to improved performance.
            The RTX 4060 Ti has 48 SMs, while the RTX 3060 Ti has 44 SMs. This means that the RTX 4060 Ti has more
            stream processors, which can also lead to improved performance.
            The RTX 4060 Ti has 16 GB of GDDR6 memory, while the RTX 3060 Ti has 8 GB of GDDR6 memory. This means that
            the RTX 4060 Ti has more memory bandwidth, which can be helpful for gaming at high resolutions and/or with
            high-quality settings.
            The RTX 4060 Ti is expected to be more expensive than the RTX 3060 Ti.
            Overall, the RTX 4060 Ti is a more powerful graphics card than the RTX 3060 Ti. However, it is also more
            expensive and may not be worth the extra cost for some users.

            Here is a table that summarizes the key differences between the two cards:

            Feature RTX 4060 Ti RTX 3060 Ti
            Architecture Ada Lovelace Turing
            Boost clock speed 1.86 GHz 1.67 GHz
            SMs 48 44
            Memory 16 GB GDDR6 8 GB GDDR6
            Memory bandwidth 215 GB/s 144 GB/s
            Price $400-$500 $300-$400
            Which card is right for you?

            The best card for you depends on your needs and budget. If you are looking for the best possible
            performance, the RTX 4060 Ti is the better choice. However, if you are on a budget or do not need the extra
            performance, the RTX 3060 Ti is a great option.</p>
