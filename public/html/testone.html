      <h6>Fast X is a 2023 American action film directed by Louis Leterrier from a screenplay written by Dan Mazeau and
        Justin Lin, who also co-wrote the story with Zach Dean. It is the sequel to F9 (2021), the tenth main
        installment, and the eleventh installment overall in the Fast & Furious franchise. It stars Vin Diesel as
        Dominic Toretto alongside an ensemble cast including Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Christopher "Ludacris"
        Bridges, John Cena, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Scott Eastwood, Daniela Melchior, Alan
        Ritchson, Helen Mirren, Brie Larson, Rita Moreno, Jason Statham, Jason Momoa, and Charlize Theron. In the film,
        Dom must protect his family from Dante Reyes, who seeks revenge for his father's death and the loss of his
        family's fortune.

        With a tenth film planned since 2014, and a two-part finale planned since October 2020, Lin was confirmed to
        return to direct with the main cast attached. The film's official title was revealed when principal photography
        began in April 2022. Lin left as director later that month, citing creative differences, though he retained
        writing and producing credits. Leterrier was then hired as his replacement a week later and performed several
        uncredited rewrites to the screenplay. Longtime franchise composer Brian Tyler returned to score the film. With
        an estimated production budget of $340 million, it is the eighth-most expensive film ever made. Filming lasted
        until that August, taking place in London, Rome, Turin, other Italian cities, Lisbon, and Los Angeles.

        Fast X premiered at The Space Cinema in Rome on May 12, 2023. It was first released in several countries across
        Europe and South America on May 17, and in the United States on May 19, by Universal Pictures. The film received
        mixed reviews from critics, who praised Momoa's performance but criticized the writing. Fast X has grossed $548
        million worldwide, becoming the fifth highest-grossing film of 2023. Two sequels to end the franchise are in
        development.

    <h6>Plot
      In 2021, Dominic Toretto and his team are requested by the Agency to steal a computer chip during its transit in
      Rome, Italy. Dom and his wife Letty Ortiz stay behind with his son Brian "Little B" Marcos, while the rest of the
      team travels to Rome. However, a wounded Cipher arrives at Dom's home and informs him that Dante Reyes, the son of
      drug lord Hernan Reyes, has turned her crew against her by threatening their families and is using them to target
      Dom in revenge for his father's death and the loss of his family's fortune ten years prior.[b] Little Nobody takes
      Cipher into custody but reveals to Dom and Letty that there is no Agency mission in Rome. Realizing that Dante set
      them up, Dom and Letty go to rescue the team.

      In Rome, Dante locks the team in a truck containing a bomb while Dom and Letty pursue them. The bomb is released
      through the streets, so Dom pushes it into the Tiber River to minimize the damage. Letty is arrested, and Agent
      Aimes, the Agency's de facto leader since Mr. Nobody's disappearance,[c] believes that Dom and his team are
      responsible for the bombing and begins a manhunt, attaching a multi-million dollar bounty. In Los Angeles, an
      armed team arrives to take Little B, who was under the care of Dom's sister Mia. Dom's brother Jakob arrives and
      defeats the team, and takes Little B to a secret location in Portugal, where they will await Dom. Mr. Nobody's
      daughter, Tess, is convinced of the team's innocence and uses God's Eye[d] to find Dom in Naples, informing him
      that Dante is in Rio de Janeiro.

      Dom confronts Dante and agrees to a race, where they are joined by Dom's friend Diogo and Isabel Neves, the sister
      of Little B's late mother Elena.[e] During the race, Dante tells Dom that he planted bombs in Diogo and Isabel's
      cars. Unable to reach Diogo, Dom crashes into Isabel to dislodge the bomb as Diogo's car explodes and Dante wins
      the race. Tess visits Letty at an Agency black site and covertly wounds her to send her to the prison's treatment
      center, where she meets Cipher. They discover the black site is in Antarctica and agree to work together to
      escape. In London, the rest of Dom's team discovers their bank accounts have been drained, so they use cash hidden
      by Roman Pearce to consult with Ramsey's associate Bowie to acquire supplies. However, Bowie reports their arrival
      to law enforcement for the bounty, leading the team to turn to Deckard Shaw for help. Deckard agrees to help them
      after learning his mother Queenie is also a fugitive for helping Dom.</h6>
