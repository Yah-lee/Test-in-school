            his mother was killed by enemies and his father never talked about it. Until he was fifteen years old, his
            martial art has made no progress due to his mother's ring absorbing all his progress. One day, Xiao Yan
            encounters the old man Yao Chen (Baron Chen) after making contact with the ring. With the help of Yao Chen,
            Xiao Yan makes great advances in martial arts, and learns of the main instigator the death of his mother.
